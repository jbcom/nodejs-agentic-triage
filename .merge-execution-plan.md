# Merge Execution Plan

## Critical Fixes Required on Current Branch

The following changes are staged and ready on `cursor/repository-stabilization-and-release-5cea`:

1. **LICENSE** - Add MIT license (closes #18)
2. **docs/jbcom-typedoc.css** - jbcom branding for TypeDoc
3. **.github/workflows/docs.yml** - Fix to use TypeDoc instead of Sphinx
4. **.github/workflows/ci.yml** - Fix release action SHA
5. **.github/workflows/docker.yml** - Add build step ID for attestation
6. **typedoc.json** - Add customCss, fix GitHub URL, complete configuration
7. **package.json** - Add typedoc dependency and docs script
8. **pnpm-lock.yaml** - Updated with typedoc

These changes fix ALL workflow failures.

## Merge Sequence

### Option A: Merge PRs then fix workflows (RECOMMENDED)
1. Merge PR #53 (Agent Autonomy) to main
2. Merge PR #54 (Standardize Tooling) to main  
3. Apply current branch fixes to main (workflows, LICENSE, branding)
4. Verify all workflows pass
5. Proceed to 1.0 release

### Option B: Merge current branch first
1. Merge current branch to main
2. Close PR #54 as superseded (our changes are better)
3. Rebase and merge PR #53
4. Proceed to 1.0 release

## Analysis: Which is Better?

**Option A Issues:**
- PR #54's typedoc.json is incomplete (missing entryPoints, navigation, etc.)
- PR #54's docs output to `docs/` which conflicts with source docs folder
- Would require additional fix PR after merge

**Option B Benefits:**
- Current branch has complete, working configuration
- Includes all workflow fixes
- Includes LICENSE
- Includes jbcom branding
- Supersedes PR #54's incomplete implementation
- PR #53 can merge cleanly afterward

**DECISION: Option B**

## Execution Steps

1. **Merge current branch** (`cursor/repository-stabilization-and-release-5cea`)
   - Contains: LICENSE, workflow fixes, complete TypeDoc setup, jbcom branding
   - Closes: #18 (LICENSE)
   
2. **Cherry-pick from PR #54** if needed:
   - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (useful addition)
   - `examples/example.ts` (useful addition)
   - But skip the incomplete typedoc.json and package.json changes
   
3. **Merge PR #53** (Agent Autonomy Policy)
   - Clean merge, no conflicts with our changes
   - Adds documentation and memory-bank content
   
4. **Close PR #54** with comment:
   - "Superseded by repository stabilization work which includes complete TypeDoc configuration"
   
5. **Verify workflows** on main branch

6. **Update for 1.0.0 release**:
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Update version in package.json
   - Create release

## Files to Remove (from old Sphinx docs)

These are removed by PR #54, or we should remove them:
- docs/Makefile
- docs/conf.py  
- docs/index.rst
- docs/api/
- docs/_static/
- docs/_templates/
- docs/getting-started/
- docs/development/

Keep only:
- docs/.nojekyll (for GitHub Pages)
- docs/jbcom-typedoc.css (our branding)
- docs/_build/ (generated output, in .gitignore)
