# Repository Stabilization Plan - v1.0 Release

## Current State Analysis

### Open Issues
1. **#18 - Missing LICENSE** (High Priority - Legal)
   - Status: Missing MIT license file
   - Resolution: Add LICENSE file

2. **#50 - Queue Manager Primitives** (Feature)
   - Status: Future enhancement, not blocking 1.0
   - Action: Mark as post-1.0 / backlog

3. **#49 - Escalation Ladder** (Feature)
   - Status: Future enhancement, not blocking 1.0
   - Action: Mark as post-1.0 / backlog

### Open PRs
1. **#54 - Standardize Tooling** (CRITICAL)
   - Migrates docs from Sphinx (Python) to TypeDoc (TypeScript)
   - Adds pre-commit hooks
   - Adds TypeDoc and examples
   - Status: Ready to merge after docs workflow fix
   - Conflicts: None reported

2. **#53 - Agent Autonomy Policy** (Documentation)
   - Adds agent operating rules
   - Adds memory-bank ecosystem session docs
   - Status: Ready to merge
   - Conflicts: None reported

### Workflow Failures (Main Branch)
1. **CI Workflow** - ✅ Tests pass, but Release job fails (action-gh-release action not found)
2. **Docs Workflow** - ❌ Fails because expects Sphinx/Python but repo is TypeScript
3. **Docker Workflow** - ❌ Fails (needs investigation)

## Root Causes

1. **Documentation Mismatch**: Workflow expects Sphinx (Python) but this is a TypeScript project
2. **Missing LICENSE**: Legal compliance issue
3. **Release Action Issue**: Using invalid SHA for softprops/action-gh-release
4. **Docs Tooling**: Should use TypeDoc for TypeScript, not Sphinx

## Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate)
1. Add LICENSE file (MIT)
2. Fix docs.yml workflow to use TypeDoc instead of Sphinx
3. Fix CI workflow release action SHA
4. Remove old Sphinx docs entirely

### Phase 2: PR Merge Sequence
1. Merge PR #53 (Agent Autonomy Policy) - minimal conflicts
2. Merge PR #54 (Standardize Tooling) - critical for docs
3. Verify all workflows pass on main

### Phase 3: Documentation Setup
1. Configure TypeDoc with jbcom branding
2. Generate initial API docs
3. Verify GitHub Pages deployment
4. Update README with correct docs links

### Phase 4: Release Preparation
1. Update CHANGELOG.md for 1.0.0
2. Update package.json version to 1.0.0
3. Tag and release 1.0.0
4. Verify NPM publish
5. Verify GitHub Release

### Phase 5: Issue Cleanup
1. Close #18 (LICENSE added)
2. Label #49, #50 as "post-1.0" and move to backlog

## Merge Sequence Decision

**Order: #53 → #54 → Fixes → Release**

Rationale:
- #53 has fewer files, less risk of conflicts
- #54 removes docs/ folder which is needed for new workflow
- Both are independent and can merge cleanly
- After merge, fix workflows on main branch
- Then proceed to 1.0 release

## Post-Merge Validation
1. All CI jobs pass ✅
2. Documentation builds and deploys ✅
3. Docker builds successfully ✅
4. License present ✅
5. Version is 1.0.0 ✅
6. CHANGELOG is current ✅
7. NPM package published ✅
8. GitHub release created ✅
